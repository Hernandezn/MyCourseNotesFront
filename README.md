# My Course Notes (Front)

A full-stack Web application that allows users to write and organize course notes or similar study material. This will fill the need for users to carry around notes, back up any associated media or references to external resources, and allow users to share their course notes with the community. The target audience is any student, trainee, or autodidact wanting to keep a study guide on hand.

This repository is for the front end.
